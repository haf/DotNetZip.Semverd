<h1>Compression Command-Line Tools</h1>

<p>The Tools/Utilities downloads for DotNetZip includes a pair of
  command-line tools that perform raw compression and decompression:
  GZip.exe and BZip2.exe .  These tools can be used from the command
  line to compress or decompress .gz and .bz2 files, respectively, from
  within batch scripts, or CMD.exe windows.
</p>

<!-- ============================================================== -->

<h2>GZip.exe</h2>

<p>This tool can be used to compress a regular file into a .gz file, or
  to decompress a .gz files into its original, uncompressed form. It
  handles files in the .gz format created by other GZIP tools, such as
  the gzip tool that is included with Linux and other operating systems,
  and the .gz files it produces on Windows can be read by the gzip tool
  on other platforms.
</p>

<p>Of interest, the GZip format handled by this tool is specified
  in <A href='http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-gzip.html'>IETF RFC
  1952</a>.  While the GZIP format can handle multiple entries within a
  single archive, in general that feature is rarely used. Instead, most
  uses of GZip compress a single file to a single .gz file. </p>

<!-- ============================================================== -->

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  GZip.exe &lt;FileToProcess&gt; [arguments]

 arguments:
   -v         - verbose output.
   -f         - force overwrite of any existing files.
   -keep      - don&apos;t delete the original file after compressing or
                decompressing it.
</pre>


<!-- ============================================================== -->

<h2>BZip2.exe</h2>

<p>This tool can be used to create .bz2 files, that conform to the BZIP2
  format.  Bzip2 was created in 1996 as a compression method and format
  that can be applied to single files. Unlike ZIP, it is not a
  multi-entry archive format - you use bzip2 to compress a single file
  into a single compressed image. By convention, for a given filename, a
  bzip2 compressor creates a new file called filename.bz2 .

<p>Using the BZip2.exe command line tool included with DotNetZip, you
  can compress regular files into .bz2 files, and you can decompress
  .bz2 files into the corresponding original file.   </p>

<p>This tool such is compatible with other bzip2 tools, such as the one
  that is included with Linux and other operating systems. The .bz2
  files that this tool produces on Windows can be read by the bzip2 tool
  on other platforms.</p>

<p>Most Bzip2 utilities delete the original file after producing the
  compressed version, and delete the compressed version after
  decompressing. This utility follows that convention.  </p>

<p>BZip2 is a compression format, similar to ZLIB, GZIP, or DEFLATE.
  BZIP2 tends to compress <em>better</em> than these other algorithms,
  but BZIP2 compressors tend to require more time to compress.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre  numberLines="true" outlining="true" >

BZip2.exe &lt;FileToProcess&gt; [arguments]

  arguments:
    -v         - verbose output.
    -f         - force overwrite of any existing files.
    -keep      - don&apos;t delete the original file after compressing
                 or decompressing it.
